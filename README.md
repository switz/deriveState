# driver

Driver is a framework agnostic, zero dependency, tiny utility for organizing boolean logic trees.

After working with state machines, I realized I was tracking UI states via a plethora of boolean flags, often intermixing const/let variables with inline ternary logic. This is inevitable when working with a library like react.

I wanted a way to carefully craft explicit states and derive common values from them. For example, a particular button component may have several states, but will always need to know:

1. is the button disabled?
2. what is the button text?

and other common values like

3. what is the popover/warning text if the button is disabled?

By segmenting our UIs into explicit states, we can design and extend our UIs in a more pragmatic and extensible way. Logic is easier to reason about, organize, and test â€“ and we can extend that logic without manipulating inline ternary expressions or fighting long lists of complex boolean logic.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add @switz/driver
```

or

```bash
$ npm i @switz/driver
```

## Simple example:

Every driver (this whole project needs a better name) reduces down to a single state. The first key in `states` to be true is the active state. Think of these as effectively if/else if statements.

```javascript
  const demoButton = driver({
    states: {
      isNotRecorded: !!match.config.dontRecord,
      isUploading: !match.demo_uploaded,
      isUploaded: !!match.demo_uploaded,
    },
    flags: {
      isDisabled: (states) => states.isNotRecorded || states.isUploading,
      text: {
        isNotRecorded: 'Demo Disabled',
        isUploading: 'Demo Uploading...',
        isUploaded: 'Download Demo',
      },
    },
  });
```

The flags are pulled from the state keys. You can pass a function (and return any value) or you can pass an object with the state keys, and whatever the current state key is will return that value.

`isDisabled` above returns a boolean value out of the states, whereas `text` returns a string that corresponds to the currently active state value.

Here's a simple example of how to use this in React/UI code:

```javascript
  <Button icon="download" disabled={!!demoButton.isDisabled}>
    {demoButton.text}
  </Button>
```

Now instead of tossing ternary statements and if else and tracking messy declarations, all of your ui state can be derived through a simpler and concise state-machine inspired function.

## Code this replaces

This is what I see a lot of UI code end up being:

```javascript
const DemoButton = ({ match }) => {
  const isUploadedText = match.demo_uploaded ? 'Demo Uploaded' : 'Demo Uploading...';

  return (
    <Button icon="download" disabled={match.config.dontRecord || !match.demo_uploaded}>
      {match.config.dontRecord ? 'Demo Not Recorded' : isUploadedText}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

Touching this code is a mess, keeping track of the state tree is hard, and interleaving state values, boolean logic, and so on is cumbersome. You could write this a million different ways.

#### Now this becomes

```javascript
const DemoButton = ({ match }) => {
  const demoButton = driver({
    states: {
      isNotRecorded: !!match.config.dontRecord,
      isUploading: !match.demo_uploaded,
      isUploaded: !!match.demo_uploaded,
    },
    flags: {
      isDisabled: (states) => states.isNotRecorded || states.isUploading,
      text: {
        isNotRecorded: 'Demo Disabled',
        isUploading: 'Demo Uploading...',
        isUploaded: 'Download Demo',
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    <Button icon="download" disabled={!!demoButton.isDisabled}>
      {demoButton.text}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

The code is "longer", but all of the logic has been moved outside of the actual JSX, it's easy to understand what is supposed to be happening at a glance, and it's far more organized.

The goal here is not to have _zero_ logic inside of your actual view, but to make it easier and more maintainable to design and build your view logic in some more complex situations.

## This is naive

I cobbled this together in a few hours or so, it's not really tested or complete. I do think I'll end up using it quite a bit, but I'll likely rewrite the API and rename it and change a lot. Please contribute if you have ideas, I'm open to everything.

## Typescript

The typing is naive and weak. Suggestions here would be helpful on how to derive the flags dynamically based on their `states` keys and `flags` values.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

To test:

```bash
bun test
```
