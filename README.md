# driver

[![Build](https://github.com/switz/driver/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/switz/driver/actions/workflows/release.yaml) ![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@switz/driver?color=blue) ![npm bundle size (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@switz/driver?color=green)

Driver is a framework agnostic, zero dependency, tiny utility for organizing boolean logic trees.

After working with state machines, I realized I was tracking UI states via a plethora of boolean values, often intermixing const/let declarations with inline ternary logic. This is inevitable when working with a library like react.

Even though state machines are very useful, often my UI state is derived from boolean logic (via API data or useStates) and not from a state machine I want to build and manually transition myself. This is effectively a dumb state machine that is controlled externally.

I wanted a way to carefully craft explicit states and derive common values from them. For example, a particular button component may have several states, but will always need to know:

1. is the button disabled?
2. what is the button text?

and other common values like

3. what is the popover/warning text if the button is disabled?

By segmenting our UIs into explicit states, we can design and extend our UIs in a more pragmatic and extensible way. Logic is easier to reason about, organize, and test â€“ and we can extend that logic without manipulating inline ternary expressions or fighting long lists of complex boolean logic.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add @switz/driver
```

or

```bash
$ npm i @switz/driver
```

## Simple example:

Every _driver_ contains a single active state. The first key in `states` to be true is the active state. Think of these as effectively if/else if statements.

This library has no dependencies and is not React specific, but it only derives values from what you pass into it and does not watch/observe for state changes which fits well into the React paradigm. Here is an example in a React component:

```javascript
const DownloadButton = ({ match }) => {
  const demoButton = driver({
    states: {
      isNotRecorded: !!match.config.dontRecord,
      isUploading: !match.demo_uploaded,
      isUploaded: !!match.demo_uploaded,
    },
    derived: {
      isDisabled: ['isNotRecorded', 'isUploading'],
      // could also write this as:
      // isDisabled: (states) => states.isNotRecorded || states.isUploading,
      text: {
        isNotRecorded: 'Demo Disabled',
        isUploading: 'Demo Uploading...',
        isUploaded: 'Download Demo',
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    <Button icon="download" disabled={!!demoButton.isDisabled}>
      {demoButton.text}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

The derived data is pulled from the state keys. You can pass a function (and return any value), an array to mark boolean derived flags, or you can pass an object with the state keys, and whatever the current state key is will return that value.

`isDisabled` is true if any of the specified state keys are active, whereas `text` returns whichever string corresponds directly to the currently active state value.

Now instead of tossing ternary statements and if else and tracking messy declarations, all of your ui state can be derived through a simpler and concise state-machine inspired pattern.

## Code this replaces

This is what I see a lot of UI code end up being:

```javascript
const DemoButton = ({ match }) => {
  const isUploadedText = match.demo_uploaded ? 'Demo Uploaded' : 'Demo Uploading...';

  return (
    <Button icon="download" disabled={match.config.dontRecord || !match.demo_uploaded}>
      {match.config.dontRecord ? 'Demo Not Recorded' : isUploadedText}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

Touching this code is a mess, keeping track of the state tree is hard, and interleaving state values, boolean logic, and so on is cumbersome. You could write this a million different ways.

#### Now this becomes

```javascript
const DemoButton = ({ match }) => {
  const demoButton = driver({
    states: {
      isNotRecorded: !!match.config.dontRecord,
      isUploading: !match.demo_uploaded,
      isUploaded: !!match.demo_uploaded,
    },
    derived: {
      isDisabled: (states) => states.isNotRecorded || states.isUploading,
      text: {
        isNotRecorded: 'Demo Disabled',
        isUploading: 'Demo Uploading...',
        isUploaded: 'Download Demo',
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    <Button icon="download" disabled={!!demoButton.isDisabled}>
      {demoButton.text}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

The code is "longer", but all of the logic has been moved outside of the actual JSX, it's easy to understand what is supposed to be happening at a glance, and it's far more organized.

The goal here is not to have _zero_ logic inside of your actual view, but to make it easier and more maintainable to design and build your view logic in some more complex situations.

## Docs

The `driver` function takes an object parameter with two keys: `states` and `derived`.

`states` is an object whose keys are the potential state values. Passing boolean values into these keys dictates which state key is currently active. The first key with a truthy value is the active state.

`derived` is an object whose keys derive their values from what the current state key is. There are three interface for the `derived` object.

### States

```javascript
// states
{
  isNotRecorded: !!match.config.dontRecord,
  isUploading: !match.demo_uploaded,
  isUploaded: !!match.demo_uploaded,
},
```

### Derived

#### Function

You can return any value you'd like out of the function using the state keys

```javascript
// derived
{
  isDisabled: (states) => states.isNotRecorded || states.isUploading,
}
```

or you can access generated enums for more flexible logic

```javascript
// derived
{
  isDisabled: (state, stateEnums, activeEnum) => (activeEnum ?? 0) <= stateEnums.isUploading,
}
```

This declares that any state key _above_ isUploading means the button is disabled (in this case, `isNotRecorded` and `isUploading`).

#### Array

By using an array, you can specify a boolean if any item in the array matches the current state:

```javascript
// derived
{
  isDisabled: ['isNotRecorded', 'isUploading'],
}
```

This is the same as writing: `(states) => states.isNotRecorded || states.isUploading` in the function API above.

#### Object lookup

If you want to have a unique value per active state, an object map is the easiest way to declare as such. Each key maps to what the value is for the active state. For Example:

```javascript
// derived
{
  text: {
    isNotRecorded: 'Demo Disabled',
    isUploading: 'Demo Uploading...',
    isUploaded: 'Download Demo',
  },
}
```

If the current state is `isNotRecorded` then the `text` key will return `'Demo Disabled'`.

`isUploading` will return `'Demo Uploading...'`, and `isUploaded` will return `'Download Demo'`.

## This is naive

I cobbled this together in a few hours or so, it's not fully tested or complete. I do think I'll end up using it quite a bit, but I'll likely rewrite the API and rename it and change a lot. Please contribute if you have ideas, I'm open to everything.

## Typescript

This library is fully typed end-to-end. That said, this is the first time I've typed a library of this kind and I'm sure it could be improved. If you run into an issue, please raise it or submit a PR.

## Local Development
